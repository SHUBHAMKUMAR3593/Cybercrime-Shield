# Cybercrime Shield
Keeping an Eagle's eye on Cybercrime and informing about twitter bot's account.

# Name
Cybercrime Shield: Eagle's eye on Cybercrime.

# Description
The objective of this project is to determine and prevent from phishing url's and too help them to detect whether a particular Twitter account is either a user or a bot.
### What is URL Phishing?
* A phishing attack means an attempt to acquire sensitive data like passwords, usernames, and other sensitive information. When this attack occurs, the attacker uses a phishing on a legitimate website to gather these details.
Phishing has become one of the most popular, most damaging, and most effective kinds of attacks used by hackers to gain entry into accounts, steal sensitive information, and scam individuals or businesses.
Our rising reliance on the internet to perform most of our daily activities has given fraudsters with the right avenue to carry out phishing attacks.
#### Some examples of URL phishing in 2020:
* 1.Berkeley University attack that happened on October 5, 2020---
These attacks were simple and targeted, designed to make users interact and build a trusted rapport. The message begins as basic greetings or job offers, and then becomes requests for money or sensitive information.
* 2.Email Security Notice (Fix security info now) that occurred September 4, 2020---
These forms of phishing emails spoofing were sophisticated and targeted and they happened at the security office intending to scare victims trick them to click on a dangerous link.
Take note that the office of the Information Security will not demand you to validate your data through an malicious links sent to your email.
* 3.Account Irregular Activity Detected on September 3, 2020---
These attacks are created to resemble legitimate UC Berkeley IT Client Services email messages, aiming to scare the victim to get them to fill in personal information. A big organization such as the Legitimate UC Berkeley IT departments will never demand your passphrase through your mail. 

# Background
It is awful to say that the same technology is being misused by cybercriminals. Thus, in a broader sense, we need to be advanced regarding the technologies and apply them to have a vision of an eagle while using the internet. Hence, advances in cybersecurity became top priority nowadays.
So,that's why I thought to develop a web-based application to deal with cybercrimes.
I focused on Botnet Detection and Phishing Detection as they have the more availing risk of harming.
This web page runs the Random Forest Algorithm and Decision Tree Classifier based model in the backend via flask App.

# Methodology
* Depenedencies Python 3, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, MatplotLib, Sklearn, flask
* URL - Phishing Detection (PhishingDetection.py, FeatureExtraction.py) Twitterbot Detection (mainpgm.py) Whole flask app.
* TwitterBotnet will be deployed on cloud through Heroku and Git.
* HTML codes will also be provided.

# Experimental Design
* Step 1: Collection and gathering of dataset.
* Step 2: Performing EDA on gathered dataset.
* Step 3: Working on Random Forest Algorithm and preparing model based on Decision Tree Classifier
* Step 4: Testing model in backend via flask app.
* Step 5: Making HTML templetes to finally deploy the model.

# Evaluation Measures
The testing would be done by giving random websites link to model some non-phishing and some phising and accuracy of model will be checked there only.
